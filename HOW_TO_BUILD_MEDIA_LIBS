  How to add or remove libraries:

	You can include or exclude libraries from build.
	
	Most libraries were enabled to be built by default, if you want to disable one of these libraries, 
	you must explicitly disable the library by using "--disable-xxxdec" option in the configure time.
	for example, if you want to disable aacdecoder library, open the tccaudiocodec_build file and add "--diable-aacdec" at the "./configure" part.
	
	On the other hand, the libraries listed below were disabled by default.
	Please contact us, if you want to use these libraries.

	1. Window Audio codec (WMA)
	2. AC3 audio codec
	3. DDP audio codec

	5. Window Video codec (WMV 7 or 8)
